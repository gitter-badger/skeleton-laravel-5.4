I am new with PHP and Laravel, I have started from zero knowledge from PHP.

I have started programmimg with php about four month ago.
First tried with Slim framework which is based for Laravel 4.

After I saw JaCurtis videos
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwAKR305CRO-Q90J---jXVzbOd4CDRbVx"> How to Build a Blog with Laravel </a>

I swiched over to Laravel 5.3 -- This skeleton is based for L5.4.

Idea is go to step by step forward.

First project;
Blog - I am building two step registeration.

Second project  Sentinel
I am try to build adviced login system with user has diffrent roles and backend admin area, not only panel but
also
- app logs for Gui
- user/roles management 
- Alert system which bring low level alert for Gui from backend. (mysql, postfix, dovecot...etc)
- Nagios / nmap extended
- Event channels; later expand for Telegram bot
- Push info to Twitter, and FB.
